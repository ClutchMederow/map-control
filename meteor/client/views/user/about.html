      <h5 class="help-header">Our Mission</h5>
      <p>Our goal is to make
      learning, trading, chatting, and data-crunching about CSGO as fun as
      the actual game.</p>
      <h5 class="help-header">The Team</h5>
      <p>Drew, aka meatsting, has been playing CSGO for over 10 years.
      His weapon of choice is AWP, but when he's desperate he goes for the AK.
      When he's not playing CSGO he support himself by building web
      applications for start-ups.</p>
      <p>Duncan, aka MrHollandsBropus, is a newbie to the scene,
      having recently moved over from the dark side (COD). When he's not playing
      CSGO he also builds web apps for start-ups.</p>
      <p>Tomi, aka lurppis, is well known in the Counter-Strike scene
      as both an analyst and a former professional 1.6 player, playing for classic teams such as Evil Geniuses.
      He was also the former co-editor-in-chief at HLTV.org. He is currently the Chief Information Officer and lead writer for IronFoil.</p>
