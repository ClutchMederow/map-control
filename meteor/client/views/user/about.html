      <h3>Who We Are</h3>
      <hr>
      <p>IronFoil was built for gamers, by gamers. Our goal is to make
      learning, trading, chatting, and data-crunching about CSGO as fun as
      the actual game!</p>
      <h3>The Team</h3>
      <hr>
      <p>Drew, aka meatsting, has been playing CSGO for over 10 years.
      His weapon of choice is AWP, but when he's desperate he goes for the AK.
      When he's not playing CSGO he support himself by building web
      applications for start-ups.</p>
      <p>Duncan, aka MrHollandsBropus, is a newbie to the scene,
      having recently moved over from the dark side (COD). When he's not playing
      CSGO he also builds web apps for start-ups.</p>
