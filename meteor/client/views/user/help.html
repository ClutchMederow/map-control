      <h3>Using IronFoil</h3>
      <hr>
      <p>IronFoil is designed as a CSGO platform. By logging in with your steam
      account, you can view any of the content on the web site. You can chat,
      post content, view CSGO analytics, etc. To trade items however you have
      to do two additional things</p>
      <p>If you want to trade items, i.e. put items on the market or use the
      real time trading feature, you have to transfer items from your Steam
      inventory to the IronFoil stash. You can do this by going to manage your
      inventory, then dragging and dropping items. When you do this, a trade
      request will be sent from IronFoil's bot to your steam account. You will
      have 2 minutes to accept this trade request or it will expire. After the
      trade is complete, you can place trade your item. At any point you can
      also move your item back to your Steam inventory by dragging and dropping
      the item from the manage your inventory screen.
      </p>
      <p>If you want to buy items, you will need to purchase IronBucks.
      IronBucks are the virtual currency that IronFoil uses. They have no value
      outside of IronFoil, but may be exchanged back into your local currency
      at any time (note: a 10% fee applies each time you cash out. See FAQ for
      more details).</p>

      <p>Our payment vendor is responsible for holding all financial
      information. IronFoil does not store <b>ANY</b> financial information on
      its servers. To purchase items, you provide your credit card, debit card,
      or bank account information to our payment vendor. After the transaction is
      successfully transferred, we give you the appropriate amount of
      IronBucks.</p>
      
      <h3>Iron Bucks</h3>
      <hr>
      <p>IronBucks are the currency you use to purchase services and goods from
      IronFoil. Using our own currency enables us to instantly provide the good
      or service without having to wait for a payment to clear. You can cash
      out IronBucks at any point to your local currency.</p>

    <h3>Trading Floor</h3>
    <p>The trading floor allows players to chat in real time. Chats occur
    within a channel. There are a number of pre-existing channels based around
    maps, guns, or meta. Players are free to create their own channels, which
    can either be public or private. Within a chat you can drag and drop
    weapons from your stash as a short-hand for typing and to indicate you actually have the
    item.</p>
  </div>
  <div id="market" class="col s12">
    <h3>Market</h3>
    <p>The market allows you to trade or sell items from your stash. After you
    go to the market, you are prompted to indicate what you items you wish to
    post and what items or cash you would like. Then the item is posted to the
    market. Sellers are free to contact you and you can agree to any deal you
    would like. You are also free to post an item multiple times, remove it
    from your stash, etc. As soon as your item is traded, removed, etc. all
    market listings related to this item will disappear.</p>
    
    <p>You can check your market listings, and view any offers you received, by
    going to your home page. You will receive notifications whenever anyone
    makes you an offer or sends you a message.</p>

    <p>You are also welcome to move freely between the trading floor and the
    market.</p>
