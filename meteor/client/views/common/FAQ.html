    <p>Q: How do you guarentee my trade will work and I won't get ripped off?</p>
    <p>A: First all items and cash are transferred from the players trading to
    us. Then, once we verify both the items and/or cash amounts are correct, we
    transfer any items to a player. Finally, after verifying the item
    transfers, we transfer the cash. On the incredibly remote chance that
    something fails, we have detailed logs to a) track down any issues and b)
    validate an insurance claim. In either case we'll make sure you're
    immediately reimbursed first and then pursue recovering our losses second.</p>

    <p>Q: How do you make money?</p>
    <p>A: We charge a 10% fee when you withdraw money from our website.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Q: Why do you have to charge a fee?</p>
    <p>A: Like all businesses, we need to make money. On the internet, you can
    either charge your users directly or sell access / data to advertisers.
    We believe that charging you, the users, directly is more honest and
    transparent. Furthermore our business has significant expenses: servers,
    payment processing, etc.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Q: So you don't sell ads?</p>
    <p>A: No, this trading platform will never host ads.  
    We believe that ads often compromise the experience of using a
    web application. Our objective is to deliver the cleanest, most intuitive user
    interface, and we refuse to compromise on that</p>
    <br>
    <p>Q: Does trading items cost anything?</p>
    <p>A: No. Items are free to trade. We only make money through our fee on
    cash withdrawals.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Q: Where are you based?</p>
    <p>A: Boston, Massachusetts. But, like pretty much all companies these
    days, our servers are in the cloud</p>
